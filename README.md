Installation: 
If you want an editable installation (recommended), first navigate to the directory where you want to place the files for massGui using Powershell. Then, launch Python and type:
      pip install -e git+https://github.com/gmondee/massGui.git#egg=massGui
If you do not want an editable installation, you can use:
      pip install git+https://github.com/gmondee/massGui.git
and it should appear with the rest of your installed packages.
